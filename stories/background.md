-   She is introverted, but only when without her friends\' company -
    she is warmhearted, patient, and a self-proclaimed meme lord.

    -   She was stubborn and uncompromising as a child, and once picked
        a nasty fight in a Linux community. She regretted that ever
        since, and vowed to change. She settled down for years to study
        the ways around open source software and culture, but she kept
        much of her rebellious insistences.
    -   In her community, she is one with many friendships, despite
        being socially awkward.
    -   She believes in personal choices, and that each person has their
        own best set of tools in mind.
    -   To her, a community is there for fun and skill sharing, and she
        makes her best effort to make Linux more useful.
    -   Instead of a diary, she keeps a book of memes and jokes from her
        community.
    -   A hopeless workaholic, she could not work without her music. She
        takes her work seriously, and never spares any detail. However,
        she makes sure to acknowledge others\' efforts.

-   She is a multilinguist and a localisation and typesetting
    enthusiast.

    -   She hoards good looking fonts, and believes that good fonts
        accentuate beautiful texts.
    -   She is sensitive to language organisation, and is obsessed with
        \"proper translation.\"

-   She enjoys tinkering with vintage computers.

    -   Her cabinets at home are overflowing with old computers and
        weird gadgets. She even gave each of them random names.
    -   Her room is always steamy with over ten computers running 24/7.
    -   She has a pet server called \"Shrimpie.\"
